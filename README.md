## Why did I make this?

I have a Database Systems course in college right now. Our teacher recommended us to download Oracle Database 19c, which is around 2.7 GB in size. Some of my friends faced issues while installing the software. So, I wanted to make a ligh weight, compact, browser based compiler, where anyone could practice SQL commands, on any device without installing a heavy software.
